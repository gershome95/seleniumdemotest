# Selenium Demo Test
This repository contains a Selenium demo project for automated testing.

**Overview**

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver to automate web browser interactions and perform automated testing of web applications. It includes example scripts for navigating web pages, interacting with elements, and performing common testing tasks.

**Technologies Used**

Python
Selenium WebDriver
ChromeDriver (or other WebDriver executable)
Unit testing framework (e.g., pytest)
Local server and database (optional, for backend testing)
Prerequisites
Before running the tests, ensure you have the following:

Python: Make sure Python is installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

WebDriver Executable: Download and install the appropriate WebDriver executable for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Google Chrome). Ensure the WebDriver executable is accessible in your system PATH.

Java Development Kit (JDK): Some features of Selenium WebDriver, such as running tests in headless mode or interacting with certain elements, require the Java Development Kit (JDK) to be installed. You can download the JDK from Oracle's website or use OpenJDK.

Local Server and Database (optional): If you're testing a web application that interacts with a backend server or database, you'll need to set up a local server and database. You can use your preferred database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Make sure the server is running and accessible before running backend tests.

**Getting Started**

To run the demo tests locally or make modifications, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/gershome95/seleniumdemotest.git.

Install the required Python dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

Set up environment variables if necessary. Some WebDriver executables or configurations may require environment variables to be set. Refer to the documentation of your WebDriver executable for details.

If you're testing a web application with a backend, ensure that your local server and database are set up and running.

Run the test scripts located in the tests directory using your preferred test runner (e.g., pytest).

Example:

Copy code
pytest tests/
View the test results and any output generated by the test scripts.
